# Opinion-ming-on-sales-prediction-using-web-scraping
In this project, we obtain data through web scraping from multiple websites, which we can utilize to predict sales. To achieve this, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data obtained from various sources, which enables us to identify the factors that significantly impact product sales. Furthermore, we make predictions using customer reviews, which we categorize as positive or negative using opinion mining. This classification assists in predicting sales and also provides insight into the areas for improvement to boost sales.
